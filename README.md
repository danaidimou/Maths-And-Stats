# Maths-And-Stats Project
A cooking website wants to improve their product page. Up until now they have had a horizontal rail. A UX designer suggested having a vertical one.

The business problem we are trying to solve is figuring out whether the media rail change will affect the user engagement and potentially the sales. 
Improving the product page might be crucial for the company because it influences the user experience. By optimizing the page layout, the company can create a more enjoyable browsing experience, potentially increasing customer satisfaction, loyalty and revenue.
However, drawbacks could include the potential for information overload if too many items are displayed at once, or it might disrupt users accustomed to the horizontal layout. Balancing the presentation of information is important to ensure that the change will have a positive impact. 
The hypothesis we’re testing concerns the impact of changing the media rail from horizontal to vertical on a cooking website’s product page. 
The null Hypothesis would be that there is no significant difference in user engagement or sales between the horizontal and vertical layouts.
The alternative hypothesis would be that the vertical media layout significantly affects user engagement compared to the horizontal one. 

An A/B test is an effective method for testing hypotheses because it allows for a controlled experiment comparing two versions to see which performs better on specific metrics. It provides clear, quantitative evidence on whether the new variant impacts user engagement or sales, making it a powerful tool for data-driven decision-making.
If that’s not convincing enough, another method that could’ve been used is a Before-and-After Study (also known as a pre-post study), where the performance of the website before and after the introduction of the vertical media rail is compared. 
Pros of A/B Testing vs. Before-and-After Study:
A/B testing simultaneously compares two versions under similar conditions, reducing the influence of external variables that might change over time.
It provides direct causality between the change and the outcome.
Cons:A/B tests require splitting traffic, which might not be feasible if the user base is small.External factors can still influence results if not perfectly controlled.
Pros:
It’s useful when it’s not possible to conduct simultaneous testing and its easier to implement if there’s a limitation on resources or technical capabilities for creating parallel versions. 
Cons:
Its vulnerability to external influences over time, is making it harder to attribute changes directly to the intervention. And it’s also not providing us with a direct comparison, as it lacks a control over variables, providing clearer evidence for decision-making.
